# Day 1

## Project Goal for Today:

Decide on the purpose of the package. Write one central function or class and put it on Github.

Example: we’re working on a package that plots the most likely galactic orbits for a user-specified subset of the Gaia catalog. Today, me and partner 1 will write a function that uses `galpy` to compute and plot orbits for a list of stars, and partners 2 and 3 will write a class for constructing the list of stars using user input. We'll use two separate git branches to do this. 

## Learning Objectives

  * Identify which development environment is most appropriate for their programming task.
  * Decide when and how to design software using functional and object oriented paradigms.
  * Use git to contribute version-controlled code
  * Be able to define "git flow," and give examples of the advantages of git flow
  * (Optional) Decide and implement parallelized Python code for “embarrassingly parallel” problems
