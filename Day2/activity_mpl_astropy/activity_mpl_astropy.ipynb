    "### 1. `matplotlib.pyplot`\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.pyplot` is a complete graphics module often used by Python developers. Check out [this gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) to understand what you can do with pyplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is by no means a comprehensive tutorial, but it will point out a few important things about `matplotlib.pyplot` objects and give advice about incorporating plotting functionality in your open-source astronomy software. There are other (excellent) plotting tools in astronomy, like Plotly, and Bokeh, but we will only discuss `matplotlib.pyplot` here.\n",
    "\n",
    "---- \n",
    "**A state** \n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.pyplot` relies on the **changing state** concept. The **state** of a programming environment is what determines the program's behavior. For example, when you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` >> import orbitize```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are modifying your environment's state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you typed ```import orbitize```, if you tried to run something like ```orbitize.plot.OrbitPlot()```, you would get an import error. However, in running the import command, you modified the state of your environment, and when you try ```orbitize.plot.OrbitPlot()```, you'll get something totally different! \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing about the ```orbitize.plot.OrbitPlot()``` code changed, but because your environment's **state** changed, the output also changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sketch represents this idea visualy:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](imgs/state_concept.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A final excellent example of this concept as it applies to matplotlib is the `matplotlib.rcParams` object, which is like a dictionary that controls the default behaviors of matplotlib plots. When you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```>> import matplotlib```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matplotlib.rcParams` object is automatically defined with default values. This is how, for example, matplotlib knows how large to make fonts and figures. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also means that you can control the default behavior of matplotlib plots by updating the state via `matplotlib.rcParams`.\n",
