# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development workshop. The goal of this program is to teach participants fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. During the workshop, participants will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a small software package from scratch. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. The workshop is free and open to folks at all career levels. Code/Astro is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

Pandemic allowing, we will offer a hybrid in-person/virtual workshop at Caltech, allowing participation both in-person and virtually. Caltech currently requires all visitors to be vaccinated and boosted, and masks are required indoors. We will monitor the COVID situation and Caltech COVID policites as the situation continues to evolve. Please indicate on the Code/Astro application form if you are interested in attending in person, and we understand if you wish to change your mind later. We also have some funds available for travel supports for folks that cannot afford to attend themselves -- just let us know on the application form!

# ​Schedule

 The workshop will held in-person (TBA on Caltech campus) and virtually over Zoom. Structured activities will occur from 9am-noon (PDT) each day. The rest of the time is unstructured and participants can work on their packages at their own pace. Due to some date conflicts, we are scheduling the last day of the workshop to be on a Saturday, which will only consist of two morning activities. Please consdier attending the workshop even if you cannot make it to the Saturday session. Topics covered each day are as follows:

| Tuesday 6/21   | Wednesday 6/22  | Thursday 6/23  | Friday 6/24  | Saturday 6/25   |
| :------------ | :------------ | :-------------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| Programming Paradigms      | Git & GitHub            | Releasing Code          | Software Testing              | Industry Panel Discussion     |
| Python Package Tutorials   | Debugging               | Code Documentation      | Parallel Programming          | Project Presentations |
| Development Environments   |                         | Code Profiling          | Anti-Discriminatory Practices |        |

Before the workshop starts, we ask all participants to complete a diagnostic assignment so that everyone is on the same page regarding Python coding, and to setup their development environment based on these [installation instructions](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/blob/main/Day0/INSTALL.md) and provide us the secret code at the end.

The Industry Panel Discussion on Saturday will start at 9am and consist of three panelists who have done software development in both academia and industry. Bring any questions you want to ask them!

# How to Apply

We require participants to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab). Participants are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there. Attendence to the workshop can either be in-person or virtual. For those that require financial assistance in any way to participate (the workshop itself is free), please contact Jason Wang (jwang4@caltech.edu), as we have funding support available for in-person and remote attendence. Anyone related to astronomy is eligible. 

**Applications for 2022 will be released very soon!**
