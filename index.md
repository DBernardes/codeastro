# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development workshop motivated by the growing usage of open-source software in astronomical research. The goal of this program is to teach participants fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. During the workshop, participants will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a small software package from scratch. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. The workshop is free and open to folks at all career levels. Code/Astro is made possible thanks to support by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

Code/Astro will be hybrid and offer both in-person and virtual synchronous participation. The in-person component will be held at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. Travel funding is available to support anyone who is accepted to the work and needs financial assistance (exact amount will depend on demand, but we anticipate to be able to cover at least the large majority of it). Funding is also available to support virtual particiaption to cover costs of food, missed work, child care, etc. Also, please note that if you are just looking for access to the course materials and do not want to participate synchronously during the workshop, you don't need to apply: the course material are on [Github](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro) with corresponding lectures posted on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb1880Rn0qkK7zTWcqGaXNbKZbxkpvUuH).

# ​Schedule
 The workshop will held in-person at Northwestern and virtually over Zoom. Structured activities will occur from 9am-noon (CDT) each day. The rest of the time is unstructured and participants can work on their packages for their group projects at their own pace. A detailed schedule and local Northwestern logsitics will be made available closer to the workshop. Topics covered each day are as follows:

| Monday July 10   | Tuesday July 11  | Wednesday July 12  | Thursday July 13  | Friday July 14   |
| :------------ | :------------ | :-------------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| Programming Paradigms      | Git & GitHub            | Releasing Code          | Software Testing              | Industry Panel Discussion     |
| Python Package Tutorials   | Debugging               | Code Documentation      | Parallel Programming          | Project Presentations |
| Development Environments   |                         | Code Profiling          | Anti-Discriminatory Practices |        |

Before the workshop starts, we ask all participants to setup their development environment based on these [installation instructions](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/blob/main/Day0/INSTALL.md) and provide us the secret code at the end (there will be a form to submit the code to).

Local Northwestern logistics will also be released closer to the workshop. 

The Industry Panel Discussion on Friday will start at 9am and consist of three panelists who have done software development in both academia and industry. Bring any questions you want to ask them!

### Industry Panelists (still finalizing)

# How to Apply

We require participants to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab). Participants are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there. Attendence to the workshop can either be in-person or virtual, but participants are expected to particpate synchronously. For those that are interested in the materials but cannot particpate in real time, the code is already on [Github](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro) with corresponding lectures from previous years posted on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb1880Rn0qkK7zTWcqGaXNbKZbxkpvUuH). For those that require financial assistance in any way to participate (the workshop itself is free), let us know on the form, as we have funding support available for in-person and remote attendence. Anyone related to astronomy is eligible. If you have questions about the application, contact Jason Wang (jason.wang@northwestern.edu). 

**Apply for the 2023 workshop at [this link](https://forms.gle/f79hTQcVQZaeJxru9)! Applications are due on January 25th, 2023.** We aim to notify all applicants in early February. 

In addition to some basic questions, the application form has some questions about your programming background and goals for taking this workshop. In the event we receive too many applications, we will use these responses to help us make decisions on admission to the workshop. Part of the application also consists of taking a diagnostic assignment. There is no need to know everything on this assignment. We are using it to get a sense of the Python expertise of the participants and to help get everyone on the same page in programming jargon. Feel free to use other resources to help complete this assignment! The demographic questions at the end are optional and are used by us to identify biases in our advertising or admissions strategy for the workshop.
