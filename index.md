# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development workshop. The goal of this program is to teach participants fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. During the workshop, participants will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a small software package from scratch. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. The workshop is free and open to folks at all career levels. Code/Astro is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

Pandemic allowing, we will offer a hybrid in-person/virtual workshop at Caltech, allowing participation both in-person and virtually. Caltech currently requires all visitors to be vaccinated and boosted, and masks are required indoors. See [logistical details](details.html) for further COVID prevention info.

# ​Schedule
 The workshop will held in-person at Caltech and virtually over Zoom. Structured activities will occur from 9am-noon (PDT) each day. The rest of the time is unstructured and participants can work on their packages at their own pace. A [detailed schedule and local Caltech logsitics are available here](details.html). Topics covered each day are as follows:

| Tuesday 6/21   | Wednesday 6/22  | Thursday 6/23  | Friday 6/24  | Saturday 6/25   |
| :------------ | :------------ | :-------------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| Programming Paradigms      | Git & GitHub            | Releasing Code          | Software Testing              | Industry Panel Discussion     |
| Python Package Tutorials   | Debugging               | Code Documentation      | Parallel Programming          | Project Presentations |
| Development Environments   |                         | Code Profiling          | Anti-Discriminatory Practices |        |

Before the workshop starts, we ask all participants to setup their development environment based on these [installation instructions](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/blob/main/Day0/INSTALL.md) and provide us the secret code at the end (there will be a form to submit the code to).

Local Caltech logistics will also be released in the coming weeks. 

The Industry Panel Discussion on Saturday will start at 9am and consist of three panelists who have done software development in both academia and industry. Bring any questions you want to ask them!

### Industry Panelists (still finalizing)
 - Denise Schmitz, Avicena (attending in person)

# How to Apply

We require participants to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab). Participants are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there. Attendence to the workshop can either be in-person or virtual. For those that require financial assistance in any way to participate (the workshop itself is free), let us know on the form, as we have funding support available for in-person and remote attendence. Anyone related to astronomy is eligible. If you have questions about the application, contact Jason Wang (jwang4@caltech.edu). 

**Apply for the 2023 workshop at [this link](https://forms.gle/f79hTQcVQZaeJxru9)! Applications are due on January 25th, 2023.** 

In addition to some basic questions, the application form has some questions about your programming background and goals for taking this workshop. In the event we receive too many applications, we will use these responses to help us make decisions on admission to the workshop. Part of the application also consists of taking a diagnostic assignment. There is no need to know everything on this assignment. We are using it to get a sense of the Python expertise of the participants and to help get everyone on the same page in programming jargon. Feel free to use other resources to help complete this assignment! The demographic questions at the end are optional and are used by us to identify biases in our advertising or admissions strategy for the workshop.
