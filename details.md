## In-Person Logistics

The mornings of each day of the workshop will be heald at [Keith Spalding 410](https://www.caltech.edu/map/campus/keith-spalding-building-of-business-services). We encourage everyone to arrive before 9am, as wee will have breakfast 
an hour before the workshop, in addition to COVID tests for everyone to take each day (we ask you test before the start of each
day's in-person session).
Lunch is on-your-own, but we suggest one of the on-campus cafes. We have three rooms reserved
in [Linde Hall](https://www.caltech.edu/map/campus/ronald-and-maxine-linde-hall-of-mathematics-and-physics) for you to work on your 
groups projects in the afternoon in. The instructors and TAs will be available there in the afternoon in those rooms to help answer any
questions, or discuss your project with you.

We will also host a workshop dinner on Thursday June 23rd at 6pm at [El Cholo Pasadena](https://goo.gl/maps/wrSY6irmCEWvSxUr9). The dinner is free to all participants.

## COVID Policy
We are adding a few measures the limit the spread of COVID at our workshop. 

 * We require all participants to wear masks during all indoor sessions.
 * We will ask each in-person participant to take a COVID test each morning before the workshop begins. We will provide the
tests, so you do not need to purchase them yourself. 
 * We recommend limiting the amount you eat indoors. Southern California weather is typically very nice in the summer, 
and outdoor dining options are available throughout Pasadena. 

## Recording Policy
We are going to record to workshop to enable broader access to the materials from Code/Astro. We plan on sharing the recordings publicly on Youtube. By attending Code/Astro either in-person or remotely, you consent to being recorded. Please contact us if you wish to be removed from recordings.
